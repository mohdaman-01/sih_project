# 🚀 Frontend Deployment Guide

## ✅ Integration Complete!

Your frontend is now connected to your Railway backend:
- **Frontend**: https://nova-s-25029.netlify.app
- **Backend**: https://web-production-935e9.up.railway.app

## 🔧 What Was Updated

### 1. API Integration (`shared/api.ts`)
- Added complete API client for Railway backend
- Configured automatic authentication handling
- Added proper TypeScript types for all endpoints

### 2. Verification System (`client/lib/verify.ts`)
- Integrated with Railway backend for real verification
- Falls back to local verification if backend unavailable
- Added OCR text extraction via backend
- Enhanced with backend verification results

### 3. Authentication (`client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Connected to Railway Google OAuth
- Handles OAuth callback from backend
- Falls back to mock auth if backend unavailable
- Automatic backend connection detection

### 4. UI Components
- **UploadBox**: Shows backend connection status
- **BackendStatus**: New admin component for monitoring
- Enhanced verification results with backend data

### 5. Environment Configuration
- Added `.env` file with Railway backend URL
- Configurable API endpoints

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Build and Deploy
```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify (automatic via Git)
git add .
git commit -m "Connect frontend to Railway backend"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify Integration
1. **Visit your Netlify site**: https://nova-s-25029.netlify.app
2. **Check backend status**: Should show "Backend Connected" 
3. **Test file upload**: Upload a certificate image
4. **Check admin panel**: `/admin` - view backend status

### Step 3: Test Features

#### Certificate Verification:
1. Go to `/verify`
2. Upload a JPEG/PNG certificate
3. Should see:
   - ✅ Backend verification results
   - 📄 OCR text extraction
   - 🔍 Registry matching
   - 📊 Detailed metadata

#### Authentication:
1. Go to `/sign-in`
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Should redirect to Railway backend OAuth
4. After auth, redirected back with user data

#### Admin Panel:
1. Go to `/admin` (sign in as admin first)
2. View backend status and health
3. See API documentation link
4. Monitor service availability

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Backend status shows "Connected"
- [ ] File upload works
- [ ] OCR text extraction works
- [ ] Verification returns results
- [ ] Google OAuth redirects properly
- [ ] Admin panel shows backend health
- [ ] API documentation accessible

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Backend Connection Issues
If you see "Offline Mode":
1. Check Railway backend is running
2. Verify URL: https://web-production-935e9.up.railway.app/health
3. Check CORS settings in backend
4. Verify environment variables

### Upload Failures
If file uploads fail:
1. Check file size (max 10MB)
2. Verify file type (JPEG/PNG)
3. Check backend logs in Railway
4. Test with smaller files first

### Authentication Issues
If Google OAuth fails:
1. Verify Google OAuth setup
2. Check redirect URIs in Google Console
3. Ensure backend environment variables set
4. Test with mock auth first

## 📊 Monitoring

### Frontend Monitoring
- Check browser console for errors
- Monitor network requests in DevTools
- Verify API responses

### Backend Monitoring
- Railway dashboard for backend health
- API documentation: `/docs`
- Health endpoint: `/health`

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** - Try all features end-to-end
2. **Set up Google OAuth** - Configure proper credentials
3. **Add PostgreSQL** - For persistent data storage
4. **Monitor performance** - Check response times
5. **Add error handling** - Improve user experience
